            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Although this sausage stew served with eggs, cheese and polenta is a traditional Romanian recipe, which has different versions in different parts of the country.</p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop the meat into rather small cubes. Pat them dry with some kitchen paper.</li>
                <li>Melt the lard or heat the oil in a cast iron pan. Fry the meat cubes until nicely browned all over. Do this in two batches if your pan is not large enough, the pan should not be overcrowded.</li>
                <li>Return all the meat cubes to the pan and add the finely chopped onion and about ½ teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Add ¼ cup water, cover and cook gently for about 20 minutes or until the meat is quite tender. Add a splash of water or so if necessary, if you notice that the dish becomes too dry.</li>
                <li>Start cooking the polenta.</li>
                <li>Cut the sausages into slices, about 1 cm/ 0.4 inch thick. Chop the garlic finely.</li>
                <li>Add the sausages, garlic, tomato paste and bay leaves to the pan.</li>
                <li>Pour the white wine, cover again and continue cooking for 10 minutes or so until the meat is very tender and the sausages are cooked through.</li>
                <li>Adjust the taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In the meantime heat the vegetable oil and fry the eggs in a large pan.</li>
                <li>Divide the stew between four serving dishes, give a fried egg on top of each dish and crumble some of the feta on top of each plate.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some parsley over the dish and serve hot with polenta and pickled vegetables.</li>
            </ol>
