            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This recipe for Serbian stuffed cabbage, or sarma, is a hearty dish that many Serbs serve every day but especially for special occasions like slavas and other holidays. Recipes vary from cook to cook, but they all consist of a meat filling wrapped in cabbage and cooked over sauerkraut.</p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Cabbage</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li> Cut the core out of the cabbage and discard. In a large pot partially filled with boiling water, steam the cabbage, cut-side down. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and steam until the outer leaves are limp, about 8 to 10 minutes. Use tongs to remove the larger softened leaves. Continue to steam and remove larger leaves as they become done until you have about 22 to 23 whole large cabbage leaves. Reserve any remaining steamed cabbage.</li>
                    <li>With a paring knife, remove the tough ribs without damaging the leaves. Discard the cabbage ribs or reserve for another use.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Make the Filling</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground chuck, ground pork, rice, and onion soup mix.</li>
                    A<li>dd a small amount of water to make the mixture easier to handle.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Assemble the Rolls</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set 3 or 4 of the leaves aside. Heap about 1/4 cup of filling onto each of the remaining cabbage leaves.</li>
                    <li>Fold the bottom of the cabbage leaf up over the meat.</li>
                    <li>Fold sides to the center and roll away from yourself to completely encase the meat.</li>
                    <li>Repeat until all the meat filling is used.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Bake the sarma.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 F.</li>
                    <li>Coarsely chop the remaining steamed cabbage, not including the reserved leaves.</li>
                    <li>Spread the chopped cabbage on the bottom of a large casserole dish or Dutch oven. Add the drained sauerkraut.</li>
                    <li>Layer on the cabbage rolls, seam-side down.</li>
                    <li>Cut the smoked ribs into pieces. Space the ribs or other smoked meat of choice between the cabbage rolls.</li>
                    <li>Cover rolls with reserved whole cabbage leaves.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the tomato sauce and soup with enough water to give it a pourable consistency.</li>
                    <li>Pour the tomato sauce over rolls until the mixture is level with rolls, but not over the top.</li>
                    <li>Cover the casserole dish and bake 1 hour.</li>
                </ol>
